# Evaluation Under Asymmetry: When Verification Dominates Generation

This folder contains figures, notes, and supporting material for the article:

**“Evaluation Under Asymmetry: When Verification Dominates Generation”**

The article examines a growing structural shift in modern AI systems:
that as generation becomes cheap and automated, verification becomes the dominant cost.

This work argues that many of today’s AI failures are not failures of capability,
but failures of evaluability.

##  What This Article Is About

Modern AI systems can generate complex artifacts—codebases, workflows, analyses,
and multi-agent pipelines—at unprecedented speed.

What has not scaled at the same rate is our ability to:

- evaluate correctness

- establish trust

- audit behavior

- explain failures

This article reframes the problem away from accuracy and performance,
and toward verification cost as a first-class constraint.

In particular, it explores:

- A taxonomy of problems based on verification cost, not solution difficulty

- Why multi-agent and agentic systems amplify verification asymmetry

- How verification can become more expensive than generation

- Why confidence can decouple from evidence in modern AI systems

- Practical, quantitative proxies for reasoning about verification difficulty

- A Verification Difficulty Index (VDI) to compare systems

- A conceptual trajectory showing how systems drift into high-risk regimes

The goal is not to argue against AI, agents, or automation,
but to make verification explicit, measurable, and designable.
