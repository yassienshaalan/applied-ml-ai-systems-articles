# How Many Plugs Away Are We?

**“How Many Plugs Away Are We”**

The article reframes how we think about modern digital resilience by shifting the focus away from uptime and average availability metrics and toward the structure of dependencies and time-to-harm. It introduces the plug metaphor for interdependent systems and argues that rare, cascading failures are a predictable outcome of highly coupled digital infrastructure.

##  What This Article Is About

As systems have become more efficient, available, and interconnected, failure modes have changed:

- Critical infrastructure that was once local and loosely coupled has become highly centralized and tightly connected. 


- Optimising for uptime alone misses when harm starts, not just when a service is down. 


- The question is not how often services fail, but how many interdependent assumptions must break before harm accumulates faster than recovery can act. 

##  Why This Matters

The article’s insights apply to:

- Societal resilience: as digital infrastructure now underlies payments, healthcare, logistics, identity, and communications. 


- Business continuity: where rare outages dominate trust, reputation, and customer impact. 


- Policy and regulation: because average-case metrics hide tail risk that matters for systemic stability. 


By focusing on time-to-impact (how long a service can degrade before causing harm) rather than just uptime, organisations can build more robust and predictable risk models.
