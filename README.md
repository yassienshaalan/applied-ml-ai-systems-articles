# Applied ML & AI Systems — Articles

This repository contains the **code, notebooks, and experimental artifacts**
supporting my writing on **applied machine learning, AI systems, and production-grade ML**.

The focus is not on toy models or benchmark chasing, but on **how ML behaves as a system**:
uncertainty, reliability, monitoring, governance, cost, and real-world constraints.

Each article is treated as a **self-contained research + engineering unit**:
you should be able to reproduce the reasoning, experiments, and outputs by following
the README inside each article folder.
